This is a folder with scripts and data to analyse aspects of the astrological theories of the 2nd century Hellenistic astrologer Vettius Valens.

## Background

In Book I of the *Anthology* ([pdf](http://www.csus.edu/indiv/r/rileymt/Vettius%20Valens%20entire.pdf) trans. Mark Riley), Vettius Valens gives lists of predictions associated with planets and combinations of planets (doubles and then triples). Here, we apply quantitative analysis of these predictions to analyse the internal consistency of these predictions. 

## Details
