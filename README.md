See the associated paper for more information:

## Background

In Book I of the *Anthology* ([pdf](http://www.csus.edu/indiv/r/rileymt/Vettius%20Valens%20entire.pdf) trans. Mark Riley), Vettius Valens gives lists of predictions associated with planets and combinations of planets (doubles and then triples). Here, we analyse the internal consistency of these predictions. 

## Details
