# Mercury, the sun, and Venus make polymaths and men of wide experience.
# These men are noble, prominent in the arts and sciences, worthy of trusts and positions.
# They easily regret what has been done, sometimes wavering and moved in all directions, or enjoying changes in their occupations.

#N.B. These don't change if vettius_triple_occurrences_lifespan is used
# Second-most common is Mars, Sun, Mercury
# "Mars, the sun, and Mercury make men of much experience, inventive in business enterprises...For the most part, they have a livelihood subject to ups and downs." (uh huh...)
# Jupiter, Sun, Mercury:
# "Jupiter, Mercury, and the sun cause men to be easily successful in business enterprises and to have many friends, to be thought worthy of trusts, honors, stewardships, association with the great, and success."
# Sun, Mercury, Moon:
# "Mercury, the sun, and the moon make revered and pure men, those who play their part well, stewards, and those who share honors and positions. They are benefactors, participants in the mysteries, troubleshooters, and they put on a great show of possessions. They become bodyguards, chamberlains, and men placed in charge of money, records, and accounts. The speech of such men will be most effective for advice or instruction."

# Let's look at the other end of the scale - the least frequent. (although N.B. order is quite small, these are all not that frequent)
# Least frequent is Saturn, Jupiter, Moon. Mentions travelling abroad and becoming lords or shipowners (not very common)?
# Saturn, Jupiter, and the moon are in harmony, bringing rank and profit, associations with the great, and gifts. Men travel abroad; they succeed in foreign lands or because of foreigners, not only in their own business, but also in othersâ€™. Men also derive benefits from women, and coming into possession /42K/ of estates and land, they become lords. Some become shipowners and thus increase their livelihood, or they manage their livelihood by getting hold of whatever is involved with water.
# Then: Saturn, Mars, Moon
# Highly negative: "Saturn, Mars, and the moon cause men to be venturesome in their business enterprises and noble, but ineffective, meeting with reversals and violence."
# Jupiter, Sun, Moon
# Starts positive but ends very negative: "Jupiter, the sun, and the moon cause distinguished, brilliant, prominent men...They are adorned with all the pomp of wealth, but do not continue happy to the end; they falter in some things and ultimately come to grief."
# Jupiter, Mars, Moon
# Again, mentions exceptional things: "Jupiter, Mars, and the moon produce shrewd men, bold, public men with many friends, men advancing to high place from humble fortune and thought worthy of trust. These men are governors, athletes, distinguished men, leaders, supervisors of the masses and of districts"
# Saturn, Venus, Moon
# "Saturn, Venus, and the moon bring vicissitudes and instability of life, especially with respect to wife, mother, and children. They impose bad manners, ingratitude, as well as jealousy and quarrels, divorces, censure, public exposure, unnatural vices. But in business these men are not without resource, sharp, full of accomplishment, profiting from legacies. They do not however retain this wealth, since they are plotted against by many,"
# In general, a hypothesis would be: the more negative and specific the sentiment is, the less frequent the combination.
# This could be tested with sentiment analysis, either computational or by hand.

# Doubles
# Triples
# +others (quadruples etc.)
