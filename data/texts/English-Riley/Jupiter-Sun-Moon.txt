Jupiter, the sun, and the moon cause distinguished, brilliant, prominent men, supervisors of public, civic, and royal affairs, governors, generals, men without peer, dictators, as well as men who are envied, maligned, and betrayed by some, men who hate their own families, man who change their minds. These men are fickle and mentally unstable, arrogant, planning for their own advantage and falling into vicissitudes. They are adorned with all the pomp of wealth, but do not continue happy to the end; they falter in some things and ultimately come to grief.
