Jupiter, Mars, and the sun are indicative of men involved in disturbances and dangers, but enthusiastic and effective in their business enterprises. These men have a share of glory: they are leaders, governors, supervisors of public matters, but are prone to fall because the hatred of the great follows them, along with threats, betrayals, plots from their families, and criminal charges. A few, lifted from average fortune by the favor of the great, have later been ruined.
