Saturn, Venus, and Mercury make intelligent, clever individuals, shrewd and designing in their business enterprises. These men, however, are unsteady and frozen in their first enterprises. They become covetous of othersâ€™ goods, accomplices in many crimes, seekers of curious lore, flexible, healing, enjoying newness, change, and travel. If, under these conditions, the configuration is afflicted, or if Mars is in aspect from the right, these men fall into disturbances and trials because of poisonings, of females, or because of legacies, or they suffer a loss of livelihood or an afflicting accusation after being wronged by women. In general they will be insecure and pained with respect to women, children, and slaves.
