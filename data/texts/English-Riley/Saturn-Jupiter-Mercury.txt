Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury when configured together produce vigorous men, stewards, trustworthy, preeminent among the masses, commanding and obeyed, handlers of money and directors of documents and accounts. Such men have an independent and adaptable nature: sometimes they appear malevolent and wicked, and they will become covetous of others’ property, thievish, and greedy, because of which they will endure upsets and crises, debts and public infamy. Sometimes these men advance because of their success in action and because of their trustworthiness. Then they gain support and are thought worthy of gifts from the great and of honors. Since they have a generous disposition, they will benefit their own family and even others’. They, however, will take part in the mysteries and in esoteric affairs, and in other respects they will inquire into the curious arts and be subtle, pretending that their character is straightforward.
