Mars, the sun, and Mercury make men of much experience, inventive in business enterprises. Although careworn and unsuccessful in the goal of their calculations, they prevail unexpectedly. Therefore such men are mentally unstable, reckless, active, hot-tempered; after rushing against their enemies and bringing charges of wrongdoing or damages against them, these men then change their minds. Occasionally they have a cowardly and despicable character. They control their emotions well, play a part, and yield to men whom they should not yield to. For the most part, they have a livelihood subject to ups and downs. On coming into anotherâ€™s control, they curse their own Fortune.
