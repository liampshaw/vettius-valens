Mercury, Mars, and Venus when configured together bring profit, high rank, occupations. These stars make men who are shrewd in giving, receiving, and undertaking other business, who are stewards, wicked and widely experienced men, men who start their careers with documents and training. They are blameworthy, wasting much wealth, generous, wallowing in loans and debts and defaulting, embezzlers of others’ money, seducers, deceiving with their charm, wealthy, malignant—but repenting of what they have done.
