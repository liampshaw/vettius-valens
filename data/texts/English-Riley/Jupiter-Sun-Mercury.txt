Jupiter, Mercury, and the sun cause men to be easily successful in business enterprises and to have many friends, to be thought worthy of trusts, honors, stewardships, association with the great, and success. Some men advance from humble origins and are honored. But they let their possessions slip from their grasp; they are easily deceived, and they become poor for some time. They do many things for religious reasons. They are not without a livelihood, but are supported by unexpected sources of high rank.
