Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury cause vigorous, enthusiastic, active men. They receive a salary for public office or military assignment or for doing royal or civic business. But they are unsteady in their livelihood and spendthrift of their goods. They are however intelligent and trustworthy stewards, easily straightening out mistakes and laying on others the criticism originally directed at them. They are maligned and fall into reversals. These stars make some men athletes, prizewinners, and trainers, skilled at many things, fond of travelling and profiting in foreign lands, but failing with their own estates.
