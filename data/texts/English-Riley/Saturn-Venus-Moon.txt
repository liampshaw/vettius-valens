Saturn, Venus, and the moon bring vicissitudes and instability of life, especially with respect to wife, mother, and children. They impose bad manners, ingratitude, as well as jealousy and quarrels, divorces, censure, public exposure, unnatural vices. But in business these men are not without resource, sharp, full of accomplishment, profiting from legacies. They do not however retain this wealth, since they are plotted against by many, and are themselves accomplices in crime and murder by poison, as well as seducers of women.
