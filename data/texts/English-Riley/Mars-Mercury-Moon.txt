Mars, the moon, and Mercury make men skillful and ingenious, easily aroused to action and very vigorous, wanting to act quickly, but being remiss, seekers of curious lore, initiates of the mysteries, and partakers of secret knowledge. They are oppressors, violent, insubordinate, covetous, falling into accusations and suits for damages, into trials and dangers, and they experience alarms because of documents and money. However, these stars do make men wealthy and lavish, although failing in their livelihood.
