Saturn, Mars, and Mercury cause crime, treachery, judgements, and alarms. Men go into debts and expenses for the sake of scriptures or mystic lore, and they suffer no ordinary tribulations and ruin. In other cases these stars make men keen and intelligent in business, leading a varied life, maligned by some because of violent and illegal activities. Occasionally they become involved in toilsome and dangerous business and fall into poverty. Then they blame their own Fortune, blaspheme the gods, and become oathbreakers and atheists. If the stars are not in their proper domicile, they bring criminal charges and imprisonment. If the stars do happen to be in their proper, operative places, these men will undertake struggles of behalf of others and will generally prevail, or they will profit from documents, from accounts, or from public office, and will increase their livelihood
