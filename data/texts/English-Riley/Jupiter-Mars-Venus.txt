Jupiter, Mars, and Venus cause men to have many friends, to be easy to associate with, to be thought worthy of association with and help from the great, to be successful and to progress with the help of women. These stars make some men high-priests, prizewinners, athletes, or supervisors of temples or of the masses. They cater to their own pleasures and at times live unsteadily, subject to ups and downs. These men are blameworthy and indiscriminate about sexual matters, experiencing public exposure and betrayal, grieved with respect to children and slaves, enjoying new associations, and enduring separations from women.
