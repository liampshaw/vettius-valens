Saturn, Jupiter, and the moon are in harmony, bringing rank and profit, associations with the great, and gifts. Men travel abroad; they succeed in foreign lands or because of foreigners, not only in their own business, but also in othersâ€™. Men also derive benefits from women, and coming into possession of estates and land, they become lords. Some become shipowners and thus increase their livelihood, or they manage their livelihood by getting hold of whatever is involved with water.
