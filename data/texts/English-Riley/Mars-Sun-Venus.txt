Mars, the sun, and Venus cause men to have many friends and to be well-known, to be thought worthy of alliances and honors. These men have many resources, love their associates, but are criticized and gossiped about. Their friendships do not last and their accomplishments are fleeting. They desire much, they spend much, they are wrongers of women, and they are very ready to be insolent. They fall into reverses and hostility through their reckless decisions.
