Mars, the sun, and the moon make bold, manly, reckless, vigorous men. They become athletes and soldiers, rulers and governors, and they make their careers through violent, hateful deeds, in laborious crafts, or in work in hard materials. They fall into reverses and into dangerous situations, and suffer hostility and attacks from the great, but if benefics are in aspect, they maintain the basis of their nativity unimpaired.
