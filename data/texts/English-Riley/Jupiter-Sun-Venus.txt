Jupiter, Venus, and the sun make men who are spectacular and glorious, but who are also petty, mentally unstable, and arrogant. Sometimes they are liberal and beneficent, though changeable. At other times they are exalted with the help of another personâ€™s fame and possessions, and although coming from humble origins, they become high-priests, prizewinners, leaders, governors, preeminent in public matters, and protectors of the masses. They are thought worthy of honors and gifts and are granted livelihoods. They will however become unnatural and blameworthy in sexual matters. If these stars happen to be rising or in operative places, then these men will be happy with their wives and children.
