Jupiter, Venus, and the moon cause vigorous, famous men, high-priests, prizewinners, overseers of temples and shrines, benefactors, men eager for fame, catering to the pleasures of the masses, of cities, or of villages. These men receive trusts and are thought worthy of honor. They are well spoken of and envied by family and friends, but experience hostility and opposition. With respect to wives and intimate friends, they are unsteady and quarrelsome, living with jealousy and separation and pain, always in suspense. Sometimes they are intimate with relatives, but not even then do they have an undisturbed homelife. They get into partnerships. They will, however, become very spectacular in their manner of life, but they are full of false show, not of the truth.
