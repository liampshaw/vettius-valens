Venus, Mars, and the moon make men who are not without resources and not inactive, but who are also fickle and mentally unstable, quixotic, beginning in confusion and putting no end to their affairs. They have great plans, are contemptuous, wandering, bold, public, martial, indiscriminate in their use of male and female partners. They are maligned and fall into insulting treatment and trials, changing friendship into enmity because of their criminal attempts, and failing in their livelihood.
