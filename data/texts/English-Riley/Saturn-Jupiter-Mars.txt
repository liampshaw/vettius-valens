Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars bring about mixtures of good things. They make some men famous, high-priestly, governing, influential, in charge of the masses, of villages, or of military matters, commanding and obeyed. These men are not adorned with great show of wealth; they are involve in reversals, accusations, and violent affrays; and they lead worried lives. These stars cause others to be graced with the possession of an income, to be masters of estates and property, and to profit from the deceased, but their reputation is low. Therefore matters must be interpreted according to the configuration of the heavenly bodies and the effects of the signs.
