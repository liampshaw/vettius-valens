Saturn, Jupiter, and the sun are unsteady and insecure. They bring failure with respect to possessions, friendships, and other business enterprises. They cause loss of possessions, and they cause some to fall into invidious accusations. These stars, having indicated help from unexpected sources or from legacies, and having increased someone’s reputation, bring ruin and accusation, along with sudden danger and plots. They do cause preeminence, guardianship of others’ business, tax gathering, and salaries, for the sake of which men endure disturbance and crises, but these stars make the basis of the nativity insecure and worrisome.
