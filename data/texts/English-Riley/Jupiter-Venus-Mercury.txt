Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus are good, bringing possession of livelihoods and success in business. Men become intelligent, straightforward, generous, sweet, loving their families, cheerful, participants in education and culture, pure, decent, worthy of honor and high rank, associated with the great, and sharing in trusts and stewardships. These men are honored with livelihoods. They foster the young and are fond of education. They are masters of slaves and they rear some and benefit them as if they were their own children. Since they are pious, they know the future from the gods, but they will become unsteady and grief-stricken with respect to wife and children.
