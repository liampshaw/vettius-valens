Mercury, the sun, and Venus make polymaths and men of wide experience. These men are noble, prominent in the arts and sciences, worthy of trusts and positions. They easily regret what has been done, sometimes wavering and moved in all directions, or enjoying changes in their occupations. They have many friends, are well known, succeed through their acquaintance with the great, and are honored with a livelihood and high rank, despite being blameworthy.
