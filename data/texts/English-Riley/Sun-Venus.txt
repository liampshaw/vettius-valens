Venus and the sun are in harmony, glorious, bestowers of good. They cause the association of male and female, they bring gifts and conveyances, and make men successful in their enterprises. Occasionally they make those men who take on popular leadership or trusts, those who are in charge of foreign/secure places, those thought worthy of stipends. These men, however, are not without grief with respect to wife and children, especially if Venus is setting.
