Venus and Mars are at odds. They make men unsteady and weak of mind; they cause rivalry and murder; they cause men to have many friends, but to be blameworthy, shameless, fickle, and equally prone to intercourse with men or women; to be malicious, and plotters of murder by poison. These stars cause men to remain with neither the good nor the bad, to be slandered and reviled because of their friendships, to be spendthrift, flitting from one occupation to another, to be eager for many things, to be wronged by women and because of them to suffer crises, upsets, and debts.
