Saturn, Mars, and the sun are indicative of forcible, outré, and dangerous matters. These stars make bold men, men of great ambition, wicked atheists, traitors, insubordinate, men who hate their own families, who abandon their own relatives to go with strangers. They are involved in contumely and dangers. They suffer falls from high places or from animals. They are afraid of burns, and are toilsome in their activities. They do not guard what they already have, but desire others’ goods. They profit from crime. If, however, the configuration happens to be military or athletic, they are toilsome, but not unsuccessful.
