Mercury and the sun make adaptable men with many friends, those flexible and self-controlled men who spend their careers in public places. These stars make pure, sensible men, men of good judgment, lovers of beauty, learned men, initiates into divine matters, beneficent, fond of their associates, independent, braggarts. These men endure reversals nobly, but are ineffective, suffering ups and downs in their livelihoods, experiencing vicissitudes. They are not poverty-stricken, but find a success proportional to the basis of their nativities.
