Saturn, Mars, and the moon cause men to be venturesome in their business enterprises and noble, but ineffective, meeting with reversals and violence. They become in turn violent, reclusive, wicked: they have a plundering and thievish disposition, and become defendants in trials. They experience detention and criminal charges, unless of course the nativity happens to be fond of wrestling or of weapons, in which case the “detention” configuration is fulfilled by the holds of wrestling. Some become injured or diseased and will suffer a violent end.
