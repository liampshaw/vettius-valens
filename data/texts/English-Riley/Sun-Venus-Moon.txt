Venus, the sun, and the moon cause famous and vigorous men, those who live with ostentation, those who are malicious and blameworthy, slandered by most people and envied/hated by the great and by their friends. They succeed and gain possessions and are raised high by Fortune, but they are also unsteady with respect to wife and children. Otherwise they are fond of their friends and travel much, finding good fortune in foreign lands.
