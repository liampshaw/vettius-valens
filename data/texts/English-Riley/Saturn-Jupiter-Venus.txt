Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus are good, helpful in occupations, bringing possessions. They cause associations of male and female, as well as friendships, advancement, and benefits from legacies. However in their associations men are slandered and envied; they are unsteady in their marriages, suffering embarrassments, hostility, and judgements. On the other hand, they are fond of their associates and easy to live with, enjoying many new friendships. They are not entirely tranquil, nor do they lack grief with respect to children and slaves.
