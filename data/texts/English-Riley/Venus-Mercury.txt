Venus and Mercury are in harmony. They make men sociable and gracious, gregarious and hedonistic, paying attention to education and sensibility, receiving honors and gifts. For those of mediocre fortune, these stars bring about the receiving of goods, selling, and exchanges, and they bring a base livelihood. These stars make men unsteady and fickle with respect to women, changeable in their agreements with them.
